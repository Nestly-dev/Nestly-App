# 🔧 Nestly App - Fixes Summary

## ✅ All Issues Fixed!

---

## 📧 1. Email Verification System (Mailjet)

### What Was Fixed:
- ✅ Enhanced error logging with detailed output
- ✅ Added better error messages for common issues
- ✅ Created test endpoint: `/api/v1/auth/test-email`
- ✅ Improved Mailjet client initialization
- ✅ Added validation checks for API keys and sender email

### Files Changed:
- `Backend/src/repository/mailjet.ts` - Enhanced logging and error handling
- `Backend/src/routes/auth.ts` - Added test email endpoint

### ⚠️ Action Required:
**You MUST verify your sender email with Mailjet:**
1. Go to: https://app.mailjet.com/account/sender
2. Login and add/verify: `atnestly@gmail.com`
3. Click the verification link they send
4. ✅ Status should show "Verified"

Without this, emails will NOT send!

### Test It:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/test-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"your-email@example.com"}'
```

### Features:

4. Local data cleared
5. Automatically redirected to Welcome screen
6. ✅ User is fully logged out!

## 🔄 Changes to AuthContext

### New State Management:
- `isAuthenticated` - Boolean (replaces `signedIn`, `authStatus`)
- `authToken` - Stored JWT token
- `user` - User data object
- `isLoading` - App initialization state

### New Functions:
- `login(token, userData)` - Saves auth data to SecureStore
- `logout()` - Clears all auth data
- `updateUser(userData)` - Updates user data

### Simplified Storage:
- Uses **SecureStore only** (removed AsyncStorage mix)
- Keys: `authToken`, `userData`, `hotelData`

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"YOUR_EMAIL@example.com"}'
```

**Expected:** Email arrives in inbox (check spam if not)

### 2. Test Complete Flow

#### A. Register → Verify → Login

1. **Register:**

   {
     "username": "Test User",
     "email": "test@example.com",
     "password": "Test123456"
   }
   ```

2. **Check Email** → Click verification link

3. **Login:**
   ```json
   POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login
   {
     "email": "test@example.com",
     "password": "Test123456"
   }
   ```

4. **Use App** → Browse hotels

5. **Logout** → Profile → Log Out

---

### 3. Test Payment Flow

2. You'll get a checkout link
3. Open link in browser
4. Use test card: `5531886652142950`
5. Complete payment

## 📊 Monitoring Logs

### Watch Backend Logs:
```bash
cd Backend
npm run dev
# Look for emoji indicators:
# 📧 = Email
# 💳 = Payment
# 🔍 = Verification

```

### Watch Frontend Logs:
- Open Metro Bundler console
- Look for console.log statements
- Check for logout messages

---
