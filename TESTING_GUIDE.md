# üß™ Nestly App - Testing & Configuration Guide

This guide will help you test and configure the email verification, payment system, and logout functionality.

---

## üìß 1. Email Verification System (Mailjet)

### Current Configuration
- **Service**: Mailjet
- **API Keys**: Already configured in `.env`
- **Sender Email**: `atnestly@gmail.com`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Verify Sender Email with Mailjet

Before emails will work, you **MUST** verify the sender email address with Mailjet:

1. **Login to Mailjet Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://app.mailjet.com/account/sender
   - Login with your Mailjet account

2. **Add/Verify Sender Email**
   - Click "Add a Sender Domain or Address"
   - Add: `atnestly@gmail.com`
   - Mailjet will send a verification email
   - Click the verification link in that email
   - ‚úÖ Status should change to "Verified"

### Test Email Configuration

**Test Endpoint**: `POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/test-email`

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "email": "your-email@example.com"
}
```

**Using curl**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/test-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"your-email@example.com"}'
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Test email sent successfully! Check your inbox."
}
```

### Check Backend Logs

When testing email, check your backend terminal for detailed logs:

```
üìß ============ EMAIL SENDING START ============
   From: atnestly@gmail.com
   To: user@example.com
   Subject: ‚úâÔ∏è Verify Your Nestly Email Address
üì§ Sending request to Mailjet...
‚úÖ Email sent successfully!
   Message ID: 123456789
   Status: success
============ EMAIL SENDING END ============
```

### Common Email Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `400 Bad Request` | Sender email not verified in Mailjet |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Check API keys in `.env` file |
| No email received | Check spam folder, verify recipient email |
| `FROM_EMAIL is not configured` | Add `FROM_EMAIL=atnestly@gmail.com` to `.env` |

## üí≥ 2. Flutterwave Payment System (Test Mode)

### Current Configuration
- **Mode**: Test Mode ‚úÖ
- **API Keys**: Already configured (FLWPUBK_TEST & FLWSECK_TEST)
- **Currency**: RWF (Rwandan Franc)

### Test Payment Flow

#### Step 1: Initiate Payment

The payment is usually triggered when a user books a hotel room. The backend will create a payment link.

**Test Card Numbers** (for Flutterwave Test Mode):

| Card Type | Card Number | CVV | Expiry | PIN |
|-----------|-------------|-----|--------|-----|
| Mastercard | `5531886652142950` | `564` | `09/32` | `3310` |
| Visa | `4187427415564246` | `828` | `09/32` | `3310` |

#### Step 2: Complete Test Payment

1. You'll receive a checkout link like: `https://checkout.flutterwave.com/v3/hosted/pay/xxx`
2. Open the link in a browser
3. Enter test card details above
4. Complete the payment flow
5. You'll be redirected back to the app

#### Step 3: Verify Payment

Backend will automatically verify the payment using the transaction reference.

### Backend Payment Logs

Look for these logs in your backend terminal:

```
üí≥ ============ PAYMENT INITIATION START ============
   Transaction Ref: rwpay_1696234567890_abc123
   Amount: 50000 RWF
   Customer: John Doe (john@example.com)
‚úÖ Payment initiated successfully!
   Status: success
   Checkout Link: https://checkout.flutterwave.com/v3/hosted/pay/...
============ PAYMENT INITIATION END ============
```

### Test Payment Verification

```
üîç ============ PAYMENT VERIFICATION START ============
   Transaction Ref: rwpay_1696234567890_abc123
   Verification Status: success
‚úÖ Payment verified successfully!
   Amount: 50000 RWF
   Payment Status: successful
============ PAYMENT VERIFICATION END ============
```

### Common Payment Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Payment link not generated | Check FLW_SECRET_KEY in `.env` |
| Invalid API keys | Ensure you're using TEST keys (FLWPUBK_TEST...) |
| Payment verification fails | Check transaction reference is correct |
| 401 Unauthorized | Verify FLW_SECRET_KEY is set correctly |

## üö™ 3. Logout Functionality

### How It Works

1. User clicks "Log Out" button in Profile screen
2. Shows loading state with "Logging Out..."
3. Calls backend `/api/v1/auth/logout` endpoint
4. Clears auth token from SecureStore
5. Clears user data from SecureStore
6. Redirects to Welcome screen

### Test Logout

1. Login to the app
2. Navigate to Profile screen
3. Scroll down to "Log Out" button
4. Click the button
5. You should see:
   - Loading indicator
   - "Logging Out..." text
   - Automatic redirect to Welcome screen

### Logout Logs

**Backend**:
```
‚úÖ Successfully logged out
```

**Frontend Console**:
```
‚úÖ Logout API call successful
‚úÖ Logout successful
```

### Common Logout Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Stays on Profile screen | Check navigation setup, ensure "Welcome" route exists |
| Auth token not cleared | Check SecureStore permissions |
| App crashes | Check AuthContext is properly wrapped around app |

## üîÑ 4. Complete Registration ‚Üí Login ‚Üí Logout Flow

### End-to-End Test

1. **Register New Account**
   ```
   POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/register
   {
     "username": "Test User",
     "email": "test@example.com",
     "password": "Test123456"
   }
   ```

2. **Check Email**
   - Open inbox for `test@example.com`
   - Click verification link
   - Should see: "Email verified successfully"

3. **Login**
   ```
   POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login
   {
     "email": "test@example.com",
     "password": "Test123456"
   }
   ```
   - If email not verified: You'll get 403 error
   - If verified: You'll get token and user data

4. **Use the App**
   - Browse hotels
   - Make a booking
   - Process payment (use test card)

5. **Logout**
